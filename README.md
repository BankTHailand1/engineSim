# engineSim
only use for learning or all my custom engine
https://github.com/ange-yaghi/engine-sim
where it can be used with

Oh yeah if u try to copy some of my engine and error don't worry it just newly stuff i try to make it happen to edit the libs of program so be careful about it

if u really want to try to use new tech and make ur life easier try to add the "calculation" to lib folder

What? didn't work? of course it will not working cuz u only add the code but program didn't even know about it yet
here is how to add it first u need to go in to "/es/" folder then add the "/calculation" folder in next u need to look in "/es/engine_sim.mr" file to add this:

what? stil error? NP cuz i already know u woulld say so cuz i'm just too lazy to add "units" in here, u may ask me why i didn't do so cuz it already exsit so i don't wamt to add it in here (other world is i don't want to get copy-right title)

here is 2nd step of adding new unit fitst u need go to "/es/constants/units.mr" and open it and add new line of code like this:

and now u have it the newly unit type and more fun in makeing new engine!
u may ask how to use it, well i'm not gonna tell u just take a look inside my code and process it by urself (use some brain and don't be air head like me)
